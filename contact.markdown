### RECOMMENDATIONS
<br />
<span style="color: grey;">*"As a musician, Vee completely understood the ideas I had in mind. She's supported my work and helped me enhance my songs with a lot of empathy and wisdom. She knows when she needs to step up or not and also settle the foundations you need as a singer on stage or in music production, a true bassist (and a true friend)."*</span>

<span style="color: grey;">*"I wanted for long time to learn playing bass guitar. Finally I decided to go for it and I was lucky enough to have Vee in my neighborhood. In only 5 hours she managed to give me a kick start that enabled me to keep practicing and learning alone! She is great teacher and fantastic bass player."*</span>

<span style="color: grey;">*"I have had the absolute pleasure of working with Vee Lourenco on various projects, where she fulfilled a multitude of positions with excellence and dedication. In 2015, Vee played bass guitar in our production of “The Man & The Mouse” which was staged at the Joburg Theatre. In this production she was heavily involved in musical arrangements and additionally acted as co-musical director. In 2018, Vee joined us once again, but this time she assisted us in the production process as part of our technical team as our stage manager with added duties of calling the show and running sound and lighting cues. With both experience on stage and behind the scenes, Vee is an asset to any production team in whatever capacity you so require. As a musician, she has an incredible ear and executes her craft with skill and finesse. As a member of the technical team, she is dependable, punctual and focussed - traits highly desirable in our industry."*</span>
